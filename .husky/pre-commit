# Pre-commit hook
# =============================================================================
# This hook runs before every commit to ensure code quality.
# It uses lint-staged to only check staged files for efficiency.
#
# What it does:
# 1. ESLint - Check for code quality issues and auto-fix where possible
# 2. Prettier - Format code consistently
#
# To bypass (use sparingly): git commit --no-verify
# =============================================================================

echo "🔍 Running pre-commit checks..."

# Run lint-staged (configured in package.json)
npx lint-staged

# Check exit code
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Pre-commit checks failed. Please fix the errors above."
  exit 1

echo "✅ Pre-commit checks passed!"
